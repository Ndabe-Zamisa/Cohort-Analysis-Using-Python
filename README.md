# Cohort Analysis using Python

## Overview
This Python data analysis project focuses on conducting cohort analysis to understand user behavior trends over time. Cohort analysis is a powerful technique for analyzing how groups of users behave over a specific period. In this project, we leverage Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to explore and visualize cohort data.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file. You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Dataset
The project utilizes the 'cohorts.csv' dataset, which contains information about user behavior over time. The dataset includes columns such as Date, New users, Returning users, Duration Day 1, and Duration Day 7.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset using Pandas and perform data cleaning tasks such as checking for missing values and converting data types.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute descriptive statistics of the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables.

3. **Trend Analysis**: Visualize trends of new and returning users over time using interactive plots created with Plotly.

4. **Duration Analysis**: Analyze duration trends on Day 1 and Day 7 to understand user engagement and retention patterns.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix of variables to identify relationships between different features.

6. **Cohort Analysis**: Perform cohort analysis by grouping data by week, calculating weekly averages of new users, returning users, and duration, and visualizing the cohort matrix using Seaborn.

## How to Run
To run the project, simply execute the provided Python script in your preferred Python environment. Ensure you have the 'cohorts.csv' dataset in the same directory as the script.


## Conclusion
The Cohort Analysis using Python project provides valuable insights into user behavior trends over time, enabling businesses to make informed decisions to improve user engagement and retention strategies. By leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities, stakeholders can gain actionable insights from cohort data to drive business growth.
